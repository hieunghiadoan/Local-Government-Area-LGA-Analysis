# Analysis Summary of Student Performance in LGA Schools

In this summary, we will provide an overview of key findings from an analysis of student performance data in LGA schools.

**General Student Performance:**
- Students in LGA schools exhibit competence in both reading and math, with no significant disparity between their scores.
- Approximately 73% of students have achieved passing grades in both subjects, indicating a balanced academic performance.

**Top-Performing Schools:**
- Independent schools emerge as the top performers, boasting an overall passing rate of around 80%.
- Interestingly, these top-performing schools have smaller student populations in comparison to government schools, with three out of the top five schools falling into the independent category.
- Math performance tends to excel in these top schools.

**Bottom-Performing Schools:**
- Conversely, four out of the five bottom-performing schools are government schools, where the overall passing percentage hovers around 66%.
- In these lower-performing schools, math and reading scores are relatively similar.

**Math and Reading Scores by Grade:**
- Students generally exhibit comparable performance in both math and reading, with no significant differences.
- Across grade levels 9, 10, 11, and 12, average scores remain fairly consistent within each school.

**Scores by School Spending:**
- Surprisingly, a negative correlation is observed between the budget per student and the overall passing percentage. Lower budgets per student are associated with higher passing rates.
  
**Scores by School Size:**
- Schools with fewer than 2000 students tend to perform better and show stronger math proficiency.
- Larger schools with over 2000 students exhibit similar performance in both subjects but generally score lower compared to the smaller schools.

**Scores by School Type:**
- Independent schools consistently outperform government schools in terms of overall academic achievement.
- Moreover, independent schools have a higher percentage of students passing in math compared to reading.
